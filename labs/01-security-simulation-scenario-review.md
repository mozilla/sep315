# Security Simulation Overview

In this section you will log into your AWS account, look around at what's in the
account and ensure that everything is setup correctly.

## Log in to your lab AWS account

You will be able to set a team name and to access the AWS Web Console and CLI from this page. Just click the console link to go to the web console, or copy paste the CLI credentials if you prefer using AWS CLI.

## Explore the AWS account contents

Familiarize yourself with the contents of your account. You'll find MozDef is
deployed in your account using CloudFormation. 

* Browse to the [CloudFormation product in the AWS console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).
* Limit the CloudFormation stacks shown in the console by typing `mozdef` in the
  stack search bar and hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd>
  ![Search for MozDef CloudFormation Stack](img/01-Search-for-MozDef-CloudFormation-Stack.png)
  * You'll see both the root CloudFormation stack called `MozDef` as well as
    the various nested stacks. All the AWS resources that makeup MozDef can be
    found in these stacks.
* Browse to the [Lambda product in the AWS console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home).
  * Click the `module-[...]-AlertWritersEnv-[...]` Lambda function to see an example
    MozDef alert and author your own

  web UI.

    load balancer. Click the copy ![copy icon](img/01-Copy-icon.png) icon to
    copy the URL to your clipboard.

### Update Kibana's Indexes

Perform the following steps to map new field data types:  

1. In the kibana UI click management.
2. Click on "Index Patterns"
3. Click "Refresh Field List" at the top right.

> Note: This pulls in any new fields from the data set to your kibana mappings.  This powers the ability to query these fields later on.

## Verify environment is complete

Ensure that you are able to get to the MozDef web UI and Kibana data visualizer
UI.
